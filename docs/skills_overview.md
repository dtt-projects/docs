## What is ReST?

ReST is an architectural style that provides lightweight Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) capabilities. Unlike SOAP which is heavyweight and requires a lot of governance defined from the outset, ReST is focused on providing simple to use verbs that provide CRUD capabilities. The format of ReST requests follows the same style as web forms that traditionally designed inside of web pages. Because it follows the http standard, it is very easy to pick up and obviates the need for the transport data to be concerned with the format of the data. ReST is a prevalent protocol in web development. More information on ReST can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

## What is JSON?

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. Like the title says it is easily manipulated in Javascript as well as other languages like Python, Java, and varients of the Java language (like Groovy). JSON objects are generally made of of named value pairs and Arrays. Name value paired items are focused on connecting a value with some name for easy retrieval. Thus a JSON object with the named value pair of "Name" : "Chris Algozzine" would connect the string Chris Algozzine with Name. Add to this the ability to put a grouping of these oredered name pairs into an array and you can represent a diverse set of data.
