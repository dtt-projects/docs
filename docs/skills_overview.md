## General Developer Skills to Know

There are several skills you'll need to work on this project effectively. Below is an introduction (or recap, if you're familiar with web development) of these skills.

### Working Together

For the team lead and developers in the group, it's important to make sure everyone is coordinated on the tasks at hand. There is a great [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3000190/how-do-programmers-work-together-on-a-project) answer on best strategies for working on a project in teams that you should check out and adopt to your choosing. You may also choose a cadence to meet up with each other to discuss progress made towards the project. If you do, conducting a [scrum meeting](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/how-to-run-a-great-scrum-meeting) may be highly beneficial. This is just a particular way of organizing daily/weekly meetings, but is in no way a requirement to getting this project done well.

### Git Best Practices

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an incredibly powerful source code manager used by almost every major software development company in the world. Knowing how to use it properly is incredibly important, and will serve you well not just for this project, but for future work opportunities as well.

Some helpful resources to start:
* [Introduction](https://try.github.io/)
* [No-frills Git Tutorial](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/git/)
* [Best Practices](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#read)
* [Learn Git as a Course](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)

### What to do When You're Stuck

Every developer, no matter how great or smart they are, will eventually run into a roadblock. If you have a specific problem with something that has been provided to you by IBM, i.e. the APIs or the `Jenkins` pipeline, please feel free to create a GitHub issue and tag our username, `dtt-projects`, or to [email us directly](mailto:laserm@us.ibm.com). If you are having problems with the language (JavaScript) or anything related to actual development, `Stack Overflow` and `Google` are your best bet to finding an answer quickly. Having to search for an answer online is extremely common in the industry and does __not__ make you any less of a software developer! If all else fails, we are here to provide support.
