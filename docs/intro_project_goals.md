## The Project: Build a Website for Sprout Creek Farm.
Your task is to create a retail application site to replace the one that already exists for the farm. Your application will be developed using the IBM cloud, and a set of newly created restful APIs specifically designed to enable retail organizations. For the website itself, you will design and implement, at minimum, the following interfaces:

1. Administration page to add Merchants and Shippers.
2. Merchant page to manage inventory
3. Customer rewards program
4. A customer page that will:
    1. Allow them to register themselves as a customer.
    2. Add a credit card to be used.
    3. Search for items to buy
    4. Purchase an Item

You may add additional features on top of these requirements as desired.

You will rely on a set of ReST based services that will provide you with the business components that you can use to perform functions: (For example: search for an item, or buy this item). The data will be returned to you as JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects.  Since the services will provide the business functionality, you will be able to focus on what it takes to build the site. Please see the [APIs](/docs/docs/api) page for more information about how to use them.

Additional requirements either set forth by your instructor or by the IBM team will be updated here as needed.
