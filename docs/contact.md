### About Contacting Us

As mentioned in the [Skills Overview](/docs/docs/skills_overview) section, if you have a specific problem with something that has been provided to you by IBM, i.e. the APIs or the `Jenkins` pipeline, please feel free to create a GitHub issue and tag our username, `dtt-projects`, or to [email us directly](mailto:laserm@us.ibm.com) at one of the provided emails above. If you are having problems with the language (JavaScript) or anything related to actual development, `Stack Overflow` and `Google` are your best bet to finding an answer quickly. Having to search for an answer online is extremely common in the industry and does __not__ make you any less of a software developer! If all else fails, we are here to provide support.
